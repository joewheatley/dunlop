                        <p>Celebrated for her distinctive visual style and narrative depth, Sara Dunlop is a director with multiple industry awards. Her work spans commercials, television, and film—most recently the six-part Channel 4 drama series Dreamers.</p>

                        <p>Her narrative short Dreamlands was the only UK film in competition at Cannes, later winning Best Narrative Short at Brooklyn.

Her work explores the personal within the epic, weaving cultural moments with emotional storytelling across all forms of media.</p>

                        <p>Sara has collaborated with brands including Nike, Apple, Vodafone, Sky, Levi's, Facebook, Expedia and the RAF, showcasing her ability to translate cinematic storytelling into compelling brand narratives. Highlights include the award-winning He's Coming Home for Women's Aid and the poignant McDonald's teen-love spot It Must Be.</p>

                        <p>Her socially-driven films—for The Havens Crisis Centre, Women's Aid, Barnardo's, The Big Issue, and Plan International—have been recognised at D&AD, Creative Circle, the British Arrows Craft Awards, amongst others including Best Director.</p>

                        <p>Beyond the screen, Sara is a passionate advocate for equitable representation in the creative industries. She served as a UK ambassador for Free The Work and supports emerging talent through Channel 4's 4Skills programme, helping to shape a more inclusive industry from the ground up.</p>
